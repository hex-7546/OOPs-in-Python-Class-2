## Bare Metal System
A computer system that runs the processes directly on the hardware without the help of any operating system. It speeds up the process and is much more efficient and optimized compared to other systems with OS running on them

# Notes
<b> Internet: </b>
-Inter means between two or more different entities and net means connection or web. So a connection between two or more computer systems or devices (smartphones, desktops, data center etc) is known as the Internet. Any device accessing the internet uses a public IP address that is assigned to it

<b>LAN: </b>
Local area network is a network of devices within a small area such as schools, colleges or offices.

<b>ISP: </b>
Internet service provider is as name says provides internet. Examples: Reliance JIO and Airtel

<b>Local Host: </b>
Its a type of an IP address which starts from "127." and remains the same for all devices

<b>OSI: </b>
It is the building block of internet. It consists of seven layers from physical layer all the way to application layer

<b>Mac Address: </b>
Address given to a specific device which signifies various information related to it is known as mac address

<b>ASML </b>
